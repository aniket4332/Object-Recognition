# Object-Recognition
In this project Tensorflow is used to implement a object recognition system. A convolutional neural network is implemented using keras on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The 10 classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks with 6000 images per class.
